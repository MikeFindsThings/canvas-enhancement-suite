# canvas-enhancement-suite
A collection of scripts and programs that makes using Canvas LMS easier for students.

Canvas LMS can be slow and combersome to use. Simple tasks like finding and downloading files for classess takes longer than they shuold.

Please feel free to suggest features that would make Canvas more usable as a student.

As of now planned helpful features include:
  - Downloading files for classes
    - By class, module, or for all classes you are enrolled in
    - Dowloading files in an easy to navagte directory structure:
```    User --|
           | -- Class1 
           |      | -- Module 1
           |      |      | -- file 1
           |      |      | -- file 2
           |      | -- Module 2
           |             | -- file 3
           |
